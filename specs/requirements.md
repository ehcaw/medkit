# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated vulnerability detection and prompt optimization system for AI-generated code. The system will scan frontend code (particularly from AI tools like v0.dev, Vercel AI, Copilot) to identify security vulnerabilities and performance issues, then generate tailored LLM prompts and documentation to guide developers in improving their code. The tool aims to bridge the gap between AI code generation and security/performance best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using AI-generated code, I want to automatically scan my code for vulnerabilities and performance issues, so that I can identify potential problems before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides AI-generated frontend code as input THEN the system SHALL analyze the code using static analysis tools
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report containing identified vulnerabilities and performance optimization opportunities
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
4. WHEN performance issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for optimization
5. IF the input code contains React components THEN the system SHALL use react-scan integration for specialized React vulnerability detection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive tailored LLM prompts based on the scan results, so that I can efficiently communicate the needed fixes to AI coding assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vulnerability scan is complete THEN the system SHALL generate context-aware LLM prompts for each identified issue
2. WHEN generating prompts THEN the system SHALL include specific code snippets and line references from the original code
3. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for the LLM on how to fix each vulnerability or performance issue
4. WHEN multiple issues are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize prompts based on severity and impact
5. IF the user specifies a preferred LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) THEN the system SHALL tailor prompt formatting for that specific model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scan code from URLs or uploaded files, so that I can analyze both local code and deployed applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a website URL THEN the system SHALL crawl and extract the frontend code for analysis
2. WHEN a user uploads code files THEN the system SHALL accept common frontend file formats (JS, TS, JSX, TSX, HTML, CSS)
3. WHEN processing URLs THEN the system SHALL handle single-page applications and dynamic content loading
4. WHEN crawling fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. IF the URL requires authentication THEN the system SHALL support basic authentication methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-focused team lead, I want detailed vulnerability reports with actionable insights, so that I can prioritize security improvements across my team's AI-generated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scan is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with vulnerability details, affected code sections, and remediation steps
2. WHEN displaying vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL include OWASP classification where applicable
3. WHEN showing performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and benchmarks for improvement
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support export formats (PDF, JSON, Markdown)
5. IF multiple scans are performed THEN the system SHALL track improvements and regressions over time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate or improve documentation based on scan findings, so that I can maintain better code documentation alongside security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scan identifies undocumented components THEN the system SHALL generate basic documentation templates
2. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL suggest documentation updates that explain secure usage patterns
3. WHEN performance optimizations are recommended THEN the system SHALL document the rationale and expected benefits
4. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL follow common documentation standards (JSDoc, TSDoc)
5. IF existing documentation is present THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements rather than replacements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate continuous scanning into my deployment pipeline, so that I can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured for continuous monitoring THEN it SHALL support webhook integrations for deployment triggers
2. WHEN new code is deployed to a monitored URL THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a new scan
3. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL send notifications via configured channels (email, Slack, etc.)
4. WHEN running in CI/CD mode THEN the system SHALL support exit codes and machine-readable output formats
5. IF scan results exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL optionally block deployments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the free tier, I want to perform limited scans to evaluate the tool, so that I can determine if it meets my needs before upgrading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the free tier THEN the system SHALL allow a limited number of scans per month
2. WHEN free tier limits are reached THEN the system SHALL display clear upgrade options and pricing
3. WHEN using the free tier THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality but with usage restrictions
4. WHEN a user upgrades THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition their account and scan history
5. IF a user exceeds free tier limits THEN the system SHALL queue additional scans until the next billing cycle or upgrade

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a paid subscriber, I want access to advanced features like browser agent monitoring and unlimited scans, so that I can maintain comprehensive security coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a paid subscription THEN the system SHALL provide unlimited scans and priority processing
2. WHEN browser agent monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor specified URLs for changes
3. WHEN changes are detected on monitored sites THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger new scans
4. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics and trend reporting
5. IF the user configures custom rules THEN the system SHALL apply these rules in addition to default vulnerability checks
